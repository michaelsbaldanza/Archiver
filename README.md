# Archiver (working title)

_Archiver_ will be a means for users to organize and view poems. A user might be interested in viewing in one place poems of a certain period, or poems that treat a particular theme or contain like imagery. With _Archiver_, users would create as many boards as they like, and post through the poetry API whatever poems they would like to add. A later version of the app would also allow users to annotate each poem, and make comments or notes on a poem.
